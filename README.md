# Context

Vector icons with context

## Inspiration

Treat **Context** as an add-on for the awesome [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com) project. Although Feather Icons are pretty versatile, there are gaps when it comes to specific use cases. **Context** is meant to fill *some* of those usecases.

## Maturity

This is still very much a work in progress. However, the tooling to generate sprites and optimized vectors is available, which can be used to generate production-ready assets.
